    <h2>Freelance Projects &amp; Contracted work</h2>
    <p>If you’re working on a project for a client, you can share with your client a maximum of 250 Nucleo icons per project. You can’t share the Nucleo source files unless the client purchases a license.</p>

    <p>If the Nucleo icons contribute to the core value of the product being sold/shared, or if you (or your client) wish to include more than 250 icons in the project, the <a href="https://nucleoapp.com/extended-license">Extended License</a> is required.</p>

    <h2>Templates, Themes, UI Kits &amp; Plugins</h2>
    <p>If you’re using Nucleo icons in templates, themes or plugins offered for sale (e.g., UI kits, Wordpress Themes, HTML/CSS Templates), <b>you can include up to 100 icons in the downloadable source files</b>. This limitation applies to the icon fonts as well.</p>

    <p>The downloadable source file has to include the <a href="https://nucleoapp.com/copyright-notice">Nucleo Copyright Notice</a>.</p>

    <p>If the Nucleo icons contribute to the core value of the template, theme or plugin sold (e.g., a theme builder where users can browse Nucleo icons and pick the ones to include in their design), or if you wish to use more than 100 Nucleo icons, you will need an <a href="https://nucleoapp.com/extended-license">Extended License</a>.</p>
    
    <p>It's not possible to purchase an Extended License if the template, theme or plugin is distributed for free.</p>

    <p>If you're offering a free and pro version of your product, the free version cannot include more than 100 icons even if you purchased an Extended License to lift the limit. The Extended License applies only to the pro version of your product.</p>

    <h2>Sharing Nucleo icons with team members</h2>
    <p>If you're the sole owner of a Nucleo license, you can share with your team members only the icons used in your work, with a maximum of 250 icons (e.g., if you're a designer, you can share with the developers of your team only the Nucleo icons used in your design files).</p>

    <p>Your team members cannot reuse the Nucleo icons in other projects unless they purchase a license.</p>
    
    <p>If more than one team member needs access to the Nucleo icons, you can consider purchasing a <a href="https://nucleoapp.com/pricing">team license</a>.</p>

    <h2>Design systems</h2>

    <p>If you wish to include the Nucleo icons in a design system available on a public server, you can use a maximum of 250 Nucleo icons, even if your team purchased a Nucleo team license. </p>

    <p>If the design system is accessible only by the members of your organization (e.g., is hosted on a password protected server), but you're the sole owner of a Nucleo license, you can share with your colleagues a maximum of 250 Nucleo icons.</p>

    <p>If the design system is on a public server, you can lift the 250 icons limit by buying an <a href="https://nucleoapp.com/extended-license">Extended License</a>. However, please keep in mind you can't provide a link/button to download all the icons.</p>

    <p>If your team purchased a Nucleo team license that covers all the users with access to the design system, and the design system is not public (e.g., is hosted on a password protected server), then there's no limitation to the number of icons that can be included.</p>

    <p>If you’re still unclear about what is or isn’t allowed under this license, please contact us at info@nucleoapp.com.</p>
